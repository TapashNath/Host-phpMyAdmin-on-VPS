To install and configure phpMyAdmin on your VPS with Nginx for the domain [YOUR DOMAIN NAME] and IP [YOUR IP ADDRESS], follow these steps:

Step 1: Update Packages
First, ensure that your system is up to date:


sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Step 2: Install Nginx, PHP, and MySQL
If you don't have Nginx, PHP, and MySQL installed yet, install them:


sudo apt install nginx php-fpm php-mysql mysql-server -y
Step 3: Install phpMyAdmin
Install phpMyAdmin by downloading it and placing it in the web directory:


sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-zip php-gd php-json php-curl -y
After installation, you'll be prompted to configure phpMyAdmin. Choose Nginx for the web server and configure the database if asked.

Step 4: Configure Nginx for phpMyAdmin
Create a new Nginx configuration file for the subdomain [YOUR DOMAIN NAME]:


sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/[YOUR DOMAIN NAME]
Add the following content to the file:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name [YOUR DOMAIN NAME];

    root /usr/share/phpmyadmin;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
+
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
Enable the new configuration:


sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/[YOUR DOMAIN NAME] /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Step 5: Configure Domain DNS
Point your domain [YOUR DOMAIN NAME] to the server's IP [YOUR IP ADDRESS] by setting up an A record in your domain provider's DNS settings.

Step 6: Restart Nginx
Restart Nginx to apply the changes:


sudo systemctl restart nginx
Step 7: Access phpMyAdmin
You can now access phpMyAdmin at http://[YOUR DOMAIN NAME].

Optional: Secure phpMyAdmin
To add additional security, consider securing phpMyAdmin with an SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt:


sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d [YOUR DOMAIN NAME]
Follow the prompts to complete SSL setup.

Now, phpMyAdmin should be running securely on https://[YOUR DOMAIN NAME].
